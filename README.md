# Introduction

## Why i chose this topic

We have visited York many times for a few reason, My daughter went to university of York residing at Halifax college throughout this time she had some part time jobs. This gave us an opportunity 
To wander and explore further whether it be attractions, restaurants cafes etc and of course the shops.
Having stayed at various places and visited many places, we feel York is indeed an exceptional pleace to visit.

There are details of interesting things to visit, i have included a map to aid routes and places, within this directions are available whether it be walking, driving etc.
Also there is a simple fun quiz.
